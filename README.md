# Welcome to ChooseADo

ChooseADo is for the people who Google "salon/barbershops in [location]". Then choose a random place and search through the reviews in hopes of finding the right person to do their hair. If they do not find the right salon/barbershop the first time this cycle repeats itself over and over soaking up their valuable time. That is unnecessary.

Because of this, I thought it was about time to create a search by hairstyle app so everyone could find stylists near them who specialize in, and have specific reviews for that hairstyle.

# Ticketing

For ticketing and allocation of work, I followed an agile methodology. I created tickets in Trello with four basic states:
<ul>
  <li>User Stories</li>
  <li>Backlog</li>
  <li>Implementation</li>
  <li>Completed and Pushed</li>
  
</ul>

# Getting Started


  


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
